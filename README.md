Commands to inspect build locally
- After npm run build, open dist/index.html
- Or run a simple static server:
  - npx serve dist
  - Open http://localhost:5000

SEO and meta
- Each project page includes meta tags for title, description, and OG image.
- Sitemap is included in the build for search engines.
- Use clear titles and short descriptions for better indexing.

Why this layout
- Clear sections make content easy to scan.
- Component-based design speeds up updates.
- Tailwind reduces custom CSS and keeps styles consistent.

Common issues and fixes
- If fonts fail to load, check the network path for font files.
- If Tailwind styles don't appear, confirm the build step included the purge config and that the file paths match.
- If a modal doesn’t open, check console for JavaScript errors and ensure data attributes match the script.

Example project flow
1. Create a small prototype in /src/projects.
2. Add a live preview page that reads a simple JSON file for content.
3. Link the preview from the projects grid.
4. When ready, build and push to the main branch.
5. Create a release on GitHub with the build artifacts.

Legal and third-party assets
- Images in the sample sections use permissive licenses or Unsplash sources.
- Check each third-party library license before using in a commercial project.
